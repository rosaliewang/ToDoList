ToDoList
This ToDoList is built on Ruby on Rails 4. It is developed by Zhizhi Liu and Yuchen Wang. 
Basically you can register a user, log in/out and create a ToDo list for the user.
The webpage would provide a page of all todos, a page of today's todos, a page of next 7 day's todos and a page of done things for review.
Despite rails, it also uses a bit of Bootstrap to make the website good-looking.
